This is a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.

##Setup and startup

    CREATE DATABASE "menuapp" WITH OWNER "menuapp" ENCODING 'UTF-8' LC_COLLATE 'Russian_Russia.1251' LC_CTYPE 'Russian_Russia.1251';
    GRANT ALL ON DATABASE "menuapp" TO "menuapp";

###Build

    mvn package

###Startup

Launch menuapp-web\target\menuapp-web-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war using your app server (I've used tomcat 8.0.30)
